# MAIS202-Kaggle-Competition
In order to reproduce results, please open the jupyter notebook and run all of the notebook from start to bottom. The notebook will automatically produce an output file with the predictions with the name of subm.csv. If you do not want to retrain the model and would prefer using the model I already trained, please follow the directions in the notebook to load the already trained model. 
To run the notebook, please download the notebook and the training/test files from the kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/mais202fall2021/). Place all the files in the same directory, and run the notebook from there.

The trained model placed 4th place in the competition with an accuracy of 87.64%
